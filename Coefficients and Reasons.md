### Formula ideas needed for civilian bs 
We can use a weight formula that starts from 80 and deducts points for every good thing done. This same logic can also be given to the server itself but not saved into the DB, just for the assign command beautification.

=======================================
Start with a value of 80, assign a minus mark for every condition fulfilled 
Take user ID
ID: 993734499

Take first 2 and last 2 digits of the ID (in this case its 9 and 9)
If  ID is less than 2 digits then take the same digit 4 times 
If its less than 3 digits then take the number twice


80-((9+9+9+9)+(7+10+9+8))=10

now assign a weight to conditions 

<hr/>

7 - pfp \
10 - username \
9 - first name \
8 - last name
