# This is a required setting, and should be a string that is used as 
# the main title for the project documentation.
# When rendering the theme this setting will be passed as the site_name 
# context variable.
site_name: PsychoPass

# Set the canonical URL of the site. 
# This will add a link tag with the canonical URL to the head section
# of each HTML page. If the 'root' of the MkDocs site will be within a 
# subdirectory of a domain, be sure to include that subdirectory in 
# the setting (https://example.com/foo/).
#
# This setting is also used for mkdocs serve: 
# the server will be mounted onto a path taken from the path component of the URL, 
# e.g. some/page.md will be served from http://127.0.0.1:8000/foo/some/page/ 
# to mimic the expected remote layout.
# default: null
site_url: https://PsychoPass.animekaizoku.com/docs/

# When set, provides a link to your repository (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab, ...) on each page.
# default: null
repo_url: https://github.com/MinistryOfWelfare/PsychoPass

# When set, provides the name for the link to your repository on each page.
# default: 'GitHub', 'Bitbucket' or 'GitLab' if the repo_url matches those domains, 
# otherwise the hostname from the repo_url.
repo_name: GitHub

# The path from the base repo_url to the docs directory when directly viewing a page,
# accounting for specifics of the repository host (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, etc), 
# the branch, and the docs directory itself. 
# MkDocs concatenates repo_url and edit_uri, and appends the input path of the page.
# When set, and if your theme supports it, provides a link directly to the page 
# in your source repository. This makes it easier to find and edit the source for 
# the page. If repo_url is not set, this option is ignored. On some themes, 
# setting this option may cause an edit link to be used in place of a repository 
# link. Other themes may show both links.
# The edit_uri supports query ('?') and fragment ('#') characters. 
# For repository hosts that use a query or a fragment to access the files, 
# the edit_uri might be set as follows. (Note the ? and # in the URI...)
edit_uri: 'edit/master/docs/docs/'

# Set the site description. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header.
# default: null
site_description: PsychoPass API documentations

# Set the name of the author. This will add a meta tag to the generated HTML header.
# default: null
site_author: animekaizoku

# Set the copyright information to be included in the documentation by the theme.
# default: null
